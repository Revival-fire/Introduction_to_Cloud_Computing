# AWS Critical Thinking Questions
#### Define Cloud Computing:
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics over the internet, or "the cloud." Instead of owning and maintaining physical hardware on-premises, organizations or individuals can access computing resources on-demand from a cloud provider like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. These services are available on a pay-as-you-go basis, allowing users to scale resources up or down based on their needs.

### Key Characteristics of Cloud Computing:
1. **On-Demand Self-Service**: Users can provision computing resources, such as virtual machines or storage, as needed without human intervention from the provider.
2. **Broad Network Access**: Resources are available over the internet and can be accessed from various devices, such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets.
3. **Resource Pooling**: Cloud providers pool resources to serve multiple customers, with resources dynamically allocated based on demand.
4. **Rapid Elasticity**: Resources can be scaled rapidly, allowing organizations to handle varying workloads without worrying about hardware limits.
5. **Measured Service**: Cloud usage is metered, and customers are billed based on the resources they consume (e.g., CPU hours, storage).

### Cloud Computing Models:
- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Provides virtualized computing resources over the internet (e.g., virtual machines, storage). Example: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine.
- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Offers a platform for developers to build and deploy applications without managing underlying infrastructure. Example: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Azure App Services.
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivers fully managed applications over the internet. Example: Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Salesforce.

### How Cloud Computing Differs from Traditional On-Premise Computing:
1. **Cost**: On-premise computing requires significant capital investment in hardware and ongoing maintenance costs. Cloud computing shifts this to an operational expense model, where you only pay for what you use.
2. **Scalability**: Cloud platforms provide virtually unlimited scalability. On-premise systems are limited by the capacity of the hardware you own, and scaling requires purchasing and installing new equipment.
3. **Maintenance**: In traditional setups, the organization is responsible for hardware maintenance, upgrades, and security. In the cloud, the provider manages infrastructure maintenance and updates.
4. **Flexibility**: Cloud computing allows organizations to quickly adapt to changes in demand, adding or removing resources with ease. On-premise environments require planning and time to scale.
5. **Availability**: Cloud providers typically offer highly redundant systems across multiple data centers, ensuring greater uptime and reliability than most on-premise setups.
6. **Global Reach**: Cloud platforms have global data centers, enabling users to deploy applications close to their customers for improved performance. On-premise infrastructure is limited to a specific geographic location.

### Concerns around Cloud Computing:

Cloud computing offers many advantages, but it also presents several challenges and risks that organizations must consider. These challenges can include data security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, vendor lock-in, and concerns about service availability and downtime. Here’s a breakdown of these risks:

### 1. **Data Security**
One of the biggest concerns with cloud computing is the security of data stored and processed off-site. Sensitive information, such as customer data or intellectual property, is at risk when handled by third-party cloud providers.

#### Key Security Challenges:
- **Data Breaches**: Storing data in the cloud increases the potential for unauthorized access or data theft, especially if encryption and access controls are weak.
- **Insider Threats**: Cloud providers and their staff may have access to sensitive data, posing a potential risk from insider threats.
- **Shared Resources**: Since cloud environments use multi-tenancy, where multiple customers share the same physical hardware, there is a potential risk of resource isolation failure leading to unauthorized data access.
- **Insecure APIs**: Cloud services often expose APIs for user access and integration, and poorly secured APIs can become a vulnerability, allowing attackers to exploit the system.

### 2. **Compliance and Legal Issues**
Cloud computing introduces challenges when it comes to adhering to regulatory requirements and legal obligations for data handling, privacy, and storage.

#### Key Compliance Challenges:
- **Data Residency and Sovereignty**: Many countries have strict laws about where sensitive data can be stored and processed. Using a global cloud provider may conflict with local regulations if data crosses borders.
- **Industry-Specific Regulations**: Certain industries, like healthcare and finance, must comply with specific regulations such as HIPAA (Healthcare) or PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry). Ensuring the cloud provider meets these standards can be complicated.
- **Auditing and Reporting**: Organizations may find it challenging to audit and monitor cloud environments to ensure they meet compliance standards, as they do not have direct control over the infrastructure.
  
### 3. **Vendor Lock-In**
Vendor lock-in occurs when switching from one cloud provider to another becomes difficult, expensive, or technically complex. This can limit an organization’s flexibility and ability to adapt to changes.

#### Key Vendor Lock-In Risks:
- **Proprietary Services**: Cloud providers offer unique services and APIs, making it challenging to migrate workloads to other platforms without significant re-engineering.
- **Data Migration Costs**: Moving large datasets from one cloud provider to another can be expensive in terms of data transfer fees, and time-consuming due to the sheer volume of data.
- **Application Dependencies**: If applications are tightly integrated with the cloud provider’s ecosystem, refactoring them to work with another provider can be resource-intensive and risky.
- **Loss of Flexibility**: An organization may lose negotiation power with the vendor if all critical services and infrastructure rely on that single provider.

### 4. **Downtime and Availability**
While cloud providers strive for high availability, no service is immune to outages or downtime. Relying solely on a cloud provider means that any service disruptions could have a significant impact on business operations.

#### Key Downtime Concerns:
- **Service Outages**: Major cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud have all experienced outages in the past, which affected businesses worldwide. Downtime can lead to lost revenue, reduced productivity, and a negative customer experience.
- **Single Points of Failure**: If all services are hosted with one cloud provider, the failure of that provider can cause a complete outage, as businesses depend entirely on external infrastructure.
- **Limited Control**: Unlike on-premise solutions where organizations have direct control over infrastructure and hardware, cloud customers depend on the cloud provider’s ability to resolve issues promptly.
- **Network Dependency**: Cloud services rely on internet connectivity. If an organization’s network connection fails, it can lose access to critical services hosted in the cloud.

### 5. **Cost Management**
While cloud computing promises cost savings, improper management of cloud resources can lead to unexpected expenses and “cloud sprawl.”

#### Key Cost Management Risks:
- **Uncontrolled Scaling**: Cloud platforms allow services to auto-scale in response to demand, which can result in unexpectedly high bills if not managed carefully.
- **Unused Resources**: Organizations may forget to deallocate unused cloud resources such as idle virtual machines, databases, or storage, leading to unnecessary charges.
- **Complex Pricing Models**: Cloud providers have complex and variable pricing models that can be difficult to predict. Users need careful planning to avoid overspending on services.

### 6. **Performance and Latency**
While cloud platforms can provide scalability and distributed computing, performance can vary depending on the application, location, and infrastructure used.

#### Key Performance Challenges:
- **Latency**: Applications hosted in the cloud may suffer from latency if data centers are far from end users or if the internet connection is slow. This can negatively affect user experience, especially for real-time applications.
- **Resource Contention**: In shared cloud environments, performance can be affected if other users or applications are consuming a large share of the resources, leading to slower response times or degraded service.

### 7. **Control and Flexibility**
In cloud environments, businesses lose some control over their infrastructure compared to on-premise systems. This lack of control can hinder certain IT strategies.

#### Key Control Challenges:
- **Limited Customization**: Cloud platforms provide standardized configurations that may limit the customization of specific applications or services compared to on-premise solutions.
- **Dependency on Cloud Provider**: Organizations must rely on the cloud provider for certain capabilities like hardware maintenance, network upgrades, and security patches. Any failure in these areas can affect the business.

### 8. **Data Loss and Backup Risks**
Although cloud providers implement redundant systems and backup policies, there is always a risk of data loss due to system failures or human errors.

#### Key Data Loss Risks:
- **Accidental Deletion**: Misconfigured applications, accidental commands, or malicious actions can lead to permanent deletion of data, especially if proper backups are not in place.
- **Backup and Recovery Costs**: While cloud providers offer backup solutions, continuous backups and disaster recovery setups can be expensive to implement and maintain.
  
### Choosing between Cloud and On-Premise Computing for Hosting a Java Containerized Application:

When deciding between cloud and on-premise computing for hosting a Java containerized application, several key factors must be evaluated: scalability, cost, flexibility, and reliability. Below is the decision-making process that would guide my choice, followed by an outline of the architectural diagram for hosting the application to serve 500 users during peak periods.

### 1. **Scalability**
- **Cloud Computing**: Cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud offer nearly infinite scalability. You can quickly scale up resources when user demand increases or scale down when it decreases. This elasticity is ideal for a containerized Java application since you can deploy additional instances during peak load times and only pay for what you use.
- **On-Premise**: Scaling on-premise requires purchasing and provisioning additional hardware, which involves upfront capital expenditure. It’s difficult to predict peak loads accurately and may result in either over-provisioning (leading to wasted resources) or under-provisioning (causing performance issues).
  
**Conclusion**: Cloud computing offers a significant advantage in terms of scalability because resources can be provisioned on-demand without the need for additional physical infrastructure.

### 2. **Cost**
- **Cloud Computing**: Cloud offers a pay-as-you-go model, where you are billed based on the resources you use. This can be cost-effective for small or medium-sized businesses, particularly for workloads that fluctuate. However, cloud costs can become high if not managed properly, especially with large-scale applications running 24/7.
- **On-Premise**: On-premise solutions require significant upfront investments in hardware, software, and maintenance. However, long-term costs might be lower for static workloads if the infrastructure is used efficiently. Yet, this is less ideal for dynamic workloads like a containerized app with fluctuating demand.

**Conclusion**: Cloud computing is more cost-efficient for this scenario due to its flexibility in pricing and the ability to optimize resource usage based on demand.

### 3. **Flexibility**
- **Cloud Computing**: The cloud provides a high degree of flexibility. Containers can be managed easily using services like AWS ECS, Azure Kubernetes Service, or Google Kubernetes Engine, which simplify orchestration, scaling, and management. Also, cloud providers offer a wide range of services that integrate with containerized applications, such as managed databases, monitoring, and security tools.
- **On-Premise**: On-premise environments can be customized more easily for specific use cases, but they lack the agility of cloud services. Managing the orchestration and lifecycle of containers manually (or with tools like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes) can become cumbersome compared to cloud-native solutions.

**Conclusion**: Cloud environments are generally more flexible due to the breadth of services available and the ease of container orchestration and management.

### 4. **Reliability**
- **Cloud Computing**: Cloud providers offer high reliability with Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that guarantee uptime, usually 99.9% or higher. Additionally, cloud infrastructure is designed for redundancy, so services can automatically failover to different regions or availability zones.
- **On-Premise**: On-premise environments can be reliable, but achieving high availability requires investment in redundant infrastructure, backup power supplies, and disaster recovery plans. This can become costly and complex to maintain.


### Final Decision:
**Cloud computing** is the better choice for hosting the containerized Java application. Its scalability, flexibility, and reliability are well-suited for dynamic, containerized environments. Additionally, the cloud's pay-as-you-go model helps control costs while ensuring resources are available to serve peak user loads. On-premise solutions could be more economical for static workloads, but for this use case, the agility and operational efficiency of the cloud provide a significant advantage.

### Explanation of Terms:

In the context of IT infrastructure and cloud services, the following terms—**fault tolerance**, **high availability**, **scalability**, **cost optimization**, and **serverless computing**—are essential for ensuring that systems are reliable, efficient, and cost-effective. Below are definitions and examples for each, along with their significance in cloud environments.

---

### 1. **Fault Tolerance**

#### Definition:
Fault tolerance refers to the ability of a system or infrastructure to continue operating properly even if one or more of its components fail. This capability ensures that services remain available and functional in the presence of hardware, software, or network failures.

#### Examples:
- **AWS Multi-AZ RDS (Relational Database Service)**: In a multi-AZ deployment, if the primary database in one availability zone fails, the system automatically switches to a secondary instance in a different availability zone without causing downtime.
- **Google Cloud Persistent Disks**: These disks automatically replicate data across multiple locations to provide redundancy, ensuring that a disk failure does not result in data loss.

#### Significance:
Fault tolerance is critical for maintaining the continuity of services and reducing the risk of outages, which can impact business operations and customer experience. It is particularly important in cloud services, where infrastructure is shared, and failure of components is not uncommon.

---

### 2. **High Availability**

#### Definition:
High availability (HA) refers to the design and implementation of systems that aim to ensure a certain level of operational performance, typically uptime, by minimizing downtime. High availability systems achieve this through redundancy, failover mechanisms, and load balancing.

#### Examples:
- **AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)**: Distributes incoming application traffic across multiple instances in different availability zones, ensuring that if one instance goes down, traffic is redirected to healthy instances.
- **Microsoft Azure Availability Zones**: Azure’s availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region. By deploying applications in multiple availability zones, users can ensure high availability even if one zone fails.

#### Significance:
High availability ensures that critical applications and services remain accessible to users, even in the event of hardware or software failures. This is especially important for customer-facing applications and mission-critical services where downtime can result in financial loss or reputational damage.

---

### 3. **Scalability**

#### Definition:
Scalability is the ability of a system to handle an increasing load of work or demand by adding resources (vertical scaling) or distributing the load across multiple systems (horizontal scaling). In cloud environments, scalability allows services to grow in response to demand without manual intervention.

#### Examples:
- **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in response to traffic patterns. For example, a web application can scale up during peak traffic and scale down when traffic subsides, optimizing resource use and performance.
- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**: Can dynamically scale the number of containers running in a cluster based on the resource usage of the containers, ensuring that the application can handle varying levels of demand.

#### Significance:
Scalability allows businesses to meet user demand without overprovisioning resources. This is crucial for applications with fluctuating traffic, as it enables cost savings during low demand and ensures performance during peak periods.

---

### 4. **Cost Optimization**

#### Definition:
Cost optimization involves making efficient use of cloud resources to minimize expenditure while maintaining required performance, security, and availability levels. It includes selecting the appropriate pricing models, eliminating unused resources, and using automation to manage resource scaling.

#### Examples:
- **AWS Reserved Instances**: These offer significant cost savings over On-Demand instances when users commit to a certain amount of usage over a period (1 or 3 years). This is ideal for workloads with predictable usage patterns.
- **Azure Cost Management and Billing**: Provides tools and recommendations for right-sizing resources, identifying idle resources, and utilizing discounts to optimize cloud spending.

#### Significance:
Cost optimization is critical for ensuring that businesses derive maximum value from their cloud investments. Without it, cloud costs can quickly spiral out of control, especially for organizations that scale rapidly or have unpredictable workloads.

---

### 5. **Serverless Computing**

#### Definition:
Serverless computing is a cloud execution model where the cloud provider automatically manages the infrastructure, dynamically allocating resources to run applications. In a serverless model, users do not manage servers directly; instead, they deploy code, and the provider handles scaling and resource provisioning.

#### Examples:
- **AWS Lambda**: Allows developers to run code without provisioning or managing servers. AWS automatically scales the application based on the number of incoming requests. For instance, Lambda can be used to process image uploads in real time in response to user actions.
- **Google Cloud Functions**: Provides a similar service to AWS Lambda, allowing developers to run event-driven code in response to HTTP requests or changes in cloud storage without managing any infrastructure.

#### Significance:
Serverless computing enables developers to focus on writing code without worrying about infrastructure management. It reduces operational overhead and improves scalability and cost efficiency, as users are only charged for the compute time consumed by their code (typically billed in milliseconds). This model is ideal for applications with variable or unpredictable workloads.

---

### Conclusion:
- **Fault tolerance** ensures systems can recover from failures without disrupting services.
- **High availability** ensures systems remain operational and accessible despite component failures.
- **Scalability** allows systems to grow dynamically based on demand, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Cost optimization** focuses on maximizing the value of cloud resources while minimizing expenses.
- **Serverless computing** abstracts infrastructure management, providing a highly scalable and cost-efficient execution model.

Each of these concepts plays a vital role in building robust, reliable, and cost-effective IT infrastructures in cloud environments, ensuring that applications can meet the dynamic demands of modern users and businesses.




### Performance Optimization of EC2 Instances:

As a junior DevOps engineer tasked with identifying and resolving performance issues on Amazon EC2 instances, it’s crucial to follow a systematic approach. This ensures that performance problems are diagnosed efficiently and resolved effectively. Below is a step-by-step guide that focuses on monitoring, analysis, and optimization techniques.

---

### Step 1: **Monitor Instance Performance Metrics**

Begin by gathering data on the current state of the EC2 instance to identify potential bottlenecks.

#### a. **AWS CloudWatch Monitoring**
- Use **Amazon CloudWatch** to monitor instance-level metrics, such as:
  - **CPU Utilization**: A high value indicates that the instance is CPU-bound.
  - **Memory Usage**: EC2 does not provide this by default, but you can install the **CloudWatch Agent** to track memory and disk metrics.
  - **Disk I/O**: High read/write values might indicate that the instance is struggling with disk performance.
  - **Network I/O**: Monitor inbound and outbound traffic to identify if the instance is network-bound.
  
#### b. **CloudWatch Alarms**
- Set **CloudWatch Alarms** on key metrics (e.g., CPU > 80%, Memory > 70%) to proactively detect performance issues.
  
#### c. **EC2 Instance Status Checks**
- Check **Instance Status Checks** to identify hardware or system-level issues that might be affecting performance.

---

### Step 2: **Analyze Log Files and Application Performance**

Application and system logs provide valuable insights into what is causing performance degradation.

#### a. **Analyze System Logs**
- Use **/var/log/messages**, **/var/log/syslog**, or **dmesg** to check for OS-level issues like disk errors or memory exhaustion.
  
#### b. **Application Logs**
- Review the logs of the running applications to detect errors, warnings, or long-running processes. Logs like **/var/log/httpd/access_log** (for Apache) or **/var/log/nginx/error.log** (for Nginx) can help spot slow requests or application errors.
  
#### c. **CloudWatch Logs**
- Stream your application and system logs to **CloudWatch Logs** for centralized log management and deeper analysis.

---

### Step 3: **Identify and Address CPU Bottlenecks**

If the **CPU Utilization** is consistently high, there are a few possible causes and solutions:

#### a. **Vertical Scaling**
- If the instance type is too small for the workload (e.g., a **t2.micro** running a CPU-intensive application), consider upgrading to a more powerful instance type with more vCPUs and better CPU credits, such as **t3.medium** or **m5.large**.

#### b. **Application Optimization**
- Identify CPU-hungry processes using commands like `top` or `htop`. Optimize or refactor the application to reduce CPU usage, such as optimizing database queries or increasing caching.
  
#### c. **Auto Scaling**
- Set up **Auto Scaling** groups to dynamically scale out EC2 instances in response to high CPU usage.

---

### Step 4: **Identify and Address Memory Issues**

Memory bottlenecks can cause slow performance or even out-of-memory (OOM) crashes.

#### a. **Monitor Memory Usage**
- Use **CloudWatch Agent** or system commands (`free -m`, `vmstat`) to monitor memory consumption.
  
#### b. **Optimize Application Memory Usage**
- Check for memory leaks in your applications by analyzing logs and profiling the application (e.g., using tools like **JVM Memory Profiler** for Java apps).
  
#### c. **Increase Memory Resources**
- Consider upgrading to a memory-optimized instance type (e.g., **r5.large** or **x1e.xlarge**) if the current instance size is insufficient for the workload.

---

### Step 5: **Check and Optimize Disk I/O**

High disk I/O can cause slow reads and writes, leading to performance degradation.

#### a. **Monitor Disk Usage**
- Use **CloudWatch** to track disk read/write operations, and on the instance, use commands like `iostat` to assess I/O performance.
  
#### b. **EBS Volume Type**
- Ensure that your **Elastic Block Store (EBS)** volume type is appropriate for the workload:
  - Use **gp3** or **io2** for high-performance applications requiring fast I/O.
  
#### c. **Provisioned IOPS**
- If the workload is highly I/O intensive, consider using **Provisioned IOPS (PIOPS)** EBS volumes for more consistent I/O performance.
  
#### d. **Optimize File System**
- For Linux instances, ensure that your file system is optimized. You can mount your EBS volumes with recommended options (e.g., using `noatime` for performance gains).
  
---

### Step 6: **Check Network Performance**

If the instance is handling web traffic or connecting to other services, network performance could be a limiting factor.

#### a. **Monitor Network Metrics**
- Use **CloudWatch** to monitor **NetworkIn** and **NetworkOut** for traffic spikes or high network usage that might be causing performance issues.
  
#### b. **Optimize Network Configuration**
- Check network settings such as MTU size to reduce packet fragmentation.
  
#### c. **Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)**
- If network performance is critical, ensure that the instance is using **Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs)** for high throughput and low latency.

---

### Step 7: **Cost Optimization While Resolving Performance Issues**

While resolving performance issues, ensure that resource usage is optimized to avoid unnecessary costs.

#### a. **Right-Size Instances**
- Use AWS **Trusted Advisor** or **Compute Optimizer** to recommend the most efficient instance size based on usage patterns.
  
#### b. **Spot Instances**
- Consider using **Spot Instances** for non-critical workloads that are fault-tolerant, reducing EC2 costs by up to 90%.
  
#### c. **Reserved Instances** 
- For predictable workloads, use **Reserved Instances** to get significant cost savings compared to On-Demand pricing.

---

### Step 8: **Implement Auto Scaling and Load Balancing**

To ensure your instances can handle traffic fluctuations while maintaining performance, implement **Auto Scaling** and **Load Balancing**.

#### a. **Auto Scaling Groups**
- Configure **Auto Scaling Groups** to automatically add or remove EC2 instances based on predefined metrics (e.g., CPU or memory utilization).
  
#### b. **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**
- Use **Elastic Load Balancer** to distribute traffic evenly across multiple instances, reducing the load on any single instance.

---

### Step 9: **Test and Optimize**

Once you’ve made changes, ensure that performance has improved by conducting tests.

#### a. **Load Testing**
- Use tools like **Apache JMeter** or **AWS Load Testing Tools** to simulate high traffic loads and assess system performance.
  
#### b. **Monitoring & Logging Continuously**
- Implement continuous monitoring with **CloudWatch Alarms**, **Prometheus**, or **Grafana** to proactively detect issues and ensure long-term optimization.




### Security Strategy for Object Storage:

Developing a comprehensive security strategy for storing internal videos in object storage involves multiple layers of protection, including encryption, access controls, and monitoring measures. Here’s a detailed strategy to ensure the security and integrity of your video data:

### 1. **Data Encryption**

#### a. **Encryption at Rest**
- **Use Server-Side Encryption (SSE)**: Enable server-side encryption provided by the object storage service (e.g., AWS S3 SSE, Google Cloud Storage SSE) to encrypt data at rest. This ensures that the videos are automatically encrypted when stored.
  - **SSE-S3/SSE-GCS**: Use the cloud provider’s managed keys for simplicity.
  - **SSE-KMS**: For enhanced control, use customer-managed keys (e.g., AWS KMS or Google Cloud KMS) to manage your own encryption keys.

#### b. **Encryption in Transit**
- **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS for uploading and downloading videos to protect data in transit from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Enable Transport Layer Security (TLS)**: Ensure that TLS is enabled for all connections to the object storage service.

---

### 2. **Access Controls**

#### a. **Authentication**
- **Implement Strong Authentication**: Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing the object storage management console and APIs. This adds an additional layer of security beyond just username and password.

#### b. **Authorization**
- **Use IAM Policies**: Implement Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to restrict access based on the principle of least privilege. Only allow users and applications that absolutely need access to the videos.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define roles for different user groups (e.g., admin, editor, viewer) and assign permissions accordingly. Ensure that only authorized personnel can perform actions such as upload, delete, or modify the videos.

#### c. **Access Logs**
- **Enable Logging**: Enable access logging on the object storage service to track who accessed which videos, when, and what actions were performed (e.g., read, write).
- **Audit Logs**: Regularly review audit logs to identify any unauthorized access attempts or anomalies in access patterns.

---

### 3. **Monitoring Measures**

#### a. **Continuous Monitoring**
- **Set Up Cloud Monitoring**: Use monitoring tools provided by the cloud provider (e.g., AWS CloudWatch, Google Cloud Monitoring) to track access logs and operational metrics related to object storage.
- **Configure Alerts**: Set up alerts for suspicious activities, such as unauthorized access attempts or excessive data retrieval that might indicate a data breach.

#### b. **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**
