To design and deploy an AWS cloud infrastructure for two company websites using reverse proxy technology, focusing on enhancing security, scalability, performance, and cost-efficiency, follow these steps:

### 1. **Infrastructure Design Overview**

- **AWS Services**: 
  - **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** for traffic distribution.
  - **Amazon EC2** instances for website hosting.
  - **Amazon Route 53** for DNS management.
  - **Amazon CloudFront** for content delivery.
  - **Amazon RDS or DynamoDB** for database needs.
  - **AWS WAF** (Web Application Firewall) for security.
  - **AWS Auto Scaling** for dynamic scaling.
  
- **Reverse Proxy**:
  - **Nginx** or **HAProxy** deployed on EC2 instances or using AWS-native services like **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.
  
### 2. **Key Considerations for the Reverse Proxy**

#### a. **Security**
- **Reverse Proxy Setup**:
  - Use **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** as a reverse proxy to handle incoming traffic for both websites, distributing it based on host headers (domain-based routing).
  - Set up **AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF)** with the ALB to filter malicious traffic and prevent DDoS attacks.
  - Implement SSL/TLS termination at the ALB level, offloading SSL encryption to the reverse proxy to reduce the load on backend servers.
  
#### b. **Scalability**
- **Auto Scaling**: Configure **Auto Scaling Groups** for EC2 instances running Nginx or HAProxy to ensure they scale automatically based on demand.
- **Elastic Load Balancer**: Use **ALB** to scale horizontally, distributing traffic among multiple instances or containers (ECS or EKS).

#### c. **Performance**
- **Content Caching**: 
  - Set up **Amazon CloudFront** as a CDN for static content caching at edge locations, reducing latency for users.
  - Implement caching on the reverse proxy (Nginx/HAProxy) to reduce load on the backend services by serving frequently requested content.
  
#### d. **Resource Optimization and Cost Efficiency**
- **Reserved Instances or Savings Plans**: Use **Reserved EC2 Instances** or **Savings Plans** for predictable workloads to reduce cost.
- **Auto Scaling**: Leverage **Auto Scaling Groups** to ensure EC2 instances are only running when required.
- **Serverless Architecture**: Use **AWS Lambda** for specific functionalities like image processing or other event-driven use cases to minimize the need for continuously running servers.
  
### 3. **Deployment Strategy**

#### a. **Step 1: DNS Setup**
- Configure **Amazon Route 53** to manage DNS for both websites, enabling traffic to be routed to the ALB.

#### b. **Step 2: Reverse Proxy Deployment**
- Deploy an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** to act as a reverse proxy. Configure it with **Host-based Routing Rules** to route traffic to the appropriate EC2 instances or containers based on the domain name.

#### c. **Step 3: Backend EC2 or Container Setup**
- Use **Amazon EC2** instances running Nginx or HAProxy behind the ALB. Alternatively, use **Amazon ECS** or **EKS** to deploy containers for a more scalable approach.
- Configure Auto Scaling for EC2 instances or containers to handle load variations.

#### d. **Step 4: Database Setup**
- Set up **Amazon RDS** for relational databases or **Amazon DynamoDB** for NoSQL needs, ensuring database scalability and reliability.
  
#### e. **Step 5: Content Delivery**
- Integrate **Amazon CloudFront** to cache static content globally for both websites, reducing latency and load on the reverse proxy.

#### f. **Step 6: Security Enhancements**
- Implement **AWS WAF** on the ALB to filter out malicious traffic.
- Use **AWS Shield** to protect against DDoS attacks.

#### g. **Step 7: Cost Optimization**
- Monitor resource usage with **AWS Cost Explorer** and adjust the number of reserved or on-demand EC2 instances as necessary.
- Use **Amazon CloudWatch** for monitoring traffic, performance, and scaling, and enable **AWS Trusted Advisor** for cost optimization recommendations.

### 4. **Sample AWS Architecture Diagram**

- **Route 53** → **Application Load Balancer** (with WAF and SSL) → **Auto-Scaling Group** (EC2/Containers with Nginx/HAProxy) → **Amazon RDS**/DynamoDB
- **Amazon CloudFront** → Cached Content Delivery

This architecture ensures both security and scalability, with efficient resource usage through caching, auto-scaling, and cost management strategies using AWS-native services.
